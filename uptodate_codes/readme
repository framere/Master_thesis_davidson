1) Adaptive deflation works and very similar to new_concept. Both based on the paper of Sadkane and Sidje

2) Dav_tobias --> Tobias code. Grob works with single growing blocks!

3) new_concept: Last implementation. Very similar to 1), but we use the selection of corrections with the algorithm ORTHO

4) Final_blocks --> it works, but needs some refinement
