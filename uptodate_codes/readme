1) Dav_tobias --> Tobias code. Grob works with single growing blocks!

2) Single_deflation_standard works based on the paper of Sadkane and Sidje (no improvement)

3) single_deflation_buffered: Very similar to 2), but we use the selection of corrections with the algorithm ORTHO. We use l_buffer to have a faster convergence at the end. Disclaimer: It does not work optimally

4) Single_deflation_modification: Same as 3), but to avoid slow convergence at the enc we defined a block davidson based on 1) for the last 10 eigenvalues

5) Final_blocks --> it works, but needs some refinement (we have a standard block size and no selective deflation implemented)

6) Selective deflation blocks --> works good (best possible) we need to test it on the real systems in order to get valid results

7) Selective deflation modification. It works but it has some problems updating the space at the end. Still unresolved issue!
